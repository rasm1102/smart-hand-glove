echo "<h2>INRODUCTION :</h2><h3><br>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were unable to walk outside for their routine medical examinations for more than a year.
Older people, women who are pregnant, and kids who have health issues should routinely monitor their health.
Rural residents lack adequate transportation options for routine testing.
Healthcare professionals who come into direct contact with patients for health checks, such as doctors and nurses, were impacted by COVID-19.
</h3><br>";
echo "<h2> TECHNOLOGY USED:</h2><br><h3> Obtaining values such as BPM, Temperature, Oxygen Level, and Flex Value by interfacing a number of sensors with the microcontroller.

Sensors Used: Max30100(Pulse Oximeter), Flex sensor, RTC module.

 The measured values are shown on an OLED display.

 To ensure that patients don't forget to take their medications on time, the RTC module is utilized as a medication remainder.

  An IoT platform called Thingspeak is utilised to facilitate communication between medical professionals and patients.</h3><br>
";
echo "<h2>SOLUTION:</h2><br><h3>
We have designed a gadget that will use wearable technology to incorporate the temperature, oxygen level, and heartbeat in order to solve this issue.

The details of patients can be pushed into cloud using IoT which makes it easier for the doctors to check the patientâ€™s temperature, oxygen level and heartbeat without physical contact.

Compared to other smart watch technologies on the market, this one might be more affordable.

This gadget can be easily accessible by the patients</h3>
